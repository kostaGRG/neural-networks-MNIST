## Intro 
This repository contains my assignments from the Neural Networks - Deep Learning university course. The course covered topics such as neural networks, support vector machines, radial basis function neural networks and autoencoders.
* The first assignment is connected to KNN and MLP repositories.
* In the second assignment the SVMs are used.
* In the third assignment we explore the RBF neural networks.
* In the fourth and final assignment we use the autoencoder structure.
